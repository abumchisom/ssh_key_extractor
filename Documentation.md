## Features

- Handles private keys (encrypted and unencrypted) and public keys.
- Supports RSA, DSA, ECDSA, and Ed25519 algorithms.
- Extracts key-specific details such as:
  - Key size
  - Algorithm
  - Curve name (for ECDSA)
  - Public exponent (for RSA)
- Displays the original content of the key file.
- Generates the public key in OpenSSH format (if applicable).
- Calculates and displays the fingerprint of the key (if possible).
- User-friendly interactive CLI interface.

## Requirements

- **Python Version**: Python 3.6 or higher
- **Dependencies**:
  - `cryptography`
  - `os`
  - `base64`
  - `binascii`

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ssh-key-extractor.git
   cd ssh-key-extractor
   ```

2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```sh
   pip install cryptography
   ```

---

## Usage

1. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python SSHCONV.py
   ```

2. Follow the interactive prompts:
   - Enter the path to your SSH key file.
   - Indicate whether the key is encrypted with a password.
   - If encrypted, provide the password when prompted.

3. View the extracted information displayed in the terminal.

## Supported Key Formats

The script supports the following key formats:

1. **Private Keys**:
   - OpenSSH private keys
   - PEM private keys (encrypted and unencrypted)

2. **Public Keys**:
   - OpenSSH public keys
   - Public keys in `authorized_keys` format

---

## Output Explanation

The script provides the following details about the SSH key:

1. **File Metadata**:
   - File path
   - File size

2. **Key Type**:
   - SSH private key
   - PEM private key
   - SSH public key
   - OpenSSH public key

3. **Algorithm**:
   - RSA
   - DSA
   - ECDSA
   - Ed25519

4. **Key-Specific Details**:
   - Key size (e.g., 2048 bits for RSA)
   - Public exponent (for RSA)
   - Curve name (for ECDSA)

5. **Public Key**:
   - The public key in OpenSSH format (if applicable)

6. **Fingerprint**:
   - A unique identifier for the key, displayed in hexadecimal format.

7. **Original Content**:
   - The raw content of the key file.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Errors

1. **File Not Found**:
   - Ensure the file path is correct and the file exists.
   - Example: `/path/to/keyfile`

2. **Permission Denied**:
   - Check the file permissions and ensure you have read access.

3. **Unsupported Key Format**:
   - The script may not support certain proprietary or non-standard key formats.

4. **Incorrect Password**:
   - If the key is encrypted, ensure you provide the correct password.

### Debugging Tips

- Use a test key file to verify the script's functionality.
- If an error occurs, check the error message displayed in the terminal for clues.
